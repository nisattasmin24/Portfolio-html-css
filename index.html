                    <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard lasnguage used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is a cornerstone technology of the internet, alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. HTML provides the basic structure of web pages by using a series of elements, which are represented by tags.
